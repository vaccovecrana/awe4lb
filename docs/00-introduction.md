# Introduction

`awe4lb` is a lightweight, high-performance Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancer designed to address specific gaps in existing solutions while maintaining simplicity and extensibility, offering a minimal yet powerful alternative to heavyweight proxies.

`awe4lb` uses a concise JSON-based DSL, making it easy to deploy and manage.

## Targeted Use Cases

Optimized for TCP/UDP proxying, TLS termination, and dynamic discovery (e.g., Kubernetes, HTTP, exec), it excels in environments needing low-overhead solutions for APIs, databases, or custom protocols.

## Minimalism

Built to handle production workloads with fewer resources than NGINX or Traefik, itâ€™s ideal for constrained environments (e.g., edge devices or small clusters).

It supports custom discovery and health checks, with a REST API and web UI for runtime management.
